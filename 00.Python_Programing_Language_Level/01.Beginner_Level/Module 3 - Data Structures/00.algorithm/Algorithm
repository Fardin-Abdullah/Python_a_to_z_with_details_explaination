Algorithm is some steps for solving a problem .These steps are proved mathematically.For solving one problem there can be 
many algorithms. So if for solving one problem if one algorithm is given it has to be proved mathematically that if 
we follow the algorithm it will solve the problem. 

Why algorithm is important?
1.Software_Engineer
2.Problem analysis capability
3.Programming competition
4.Machine Learning, AI

There are many ways to write algorithm among them pseudocode is best
