If in a binary tree every node has two child except leaf node then it is called full binary tree.

If in a binary tree the second last level node has two child but last level node complete from left side 
to right side and second last level right side node has left node then it is called complete binary.

Heap is complete binary tree. 
If in hip every node is larger than both child nodes then it is max hip
If in hip every node is smaller than both child nodes then it is min hip

Max heap: Every node is similar or larger than both child nodes
